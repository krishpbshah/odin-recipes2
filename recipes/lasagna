    <h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li> <br>
        <li> <strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li> <br>
        <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        </li> <br>
        <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li> <br>

        </ul>
